# BCAD2PROG6212MultipleChoiceTestManagementSystem
A multiple choice test management system written in C# .Net Framework WPF using Visual Studio 2017. 
I was assigned to develop this system for a Portfolio of Evidence for my PROG6212 programming module. 
This was developed during my 2nd year of my Bachelors in Application Development degree in 2019. The final submission of this project was graded 85 out of 100.
